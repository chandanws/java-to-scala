**Find Your Natural Study Cycle**

* Book has 7 Milestones. Each Milestone takes almost consumes same amount of time
* Review each Milestone and find the number of days, you can devote to finish a Milestone. Call it **Study Cycle**

* Now the critical fact. We are Assuming tha **Your Plan will Fail** in most of the cases

**Example Plan**

* Following is the example appraoch, you can make your own version of it...
  * Finish 1st Milestone within your First Study Cycle e.g. First Week
  * Finish 2nd Milestone within your Second Study Cycle e.g. Second Week
  * Revisit 1st Milestone and 2nd Milestone in your Third Study Cycle e.g. Third Week
  * If you are not able to start 3rd Milestone, keep visiting CheatSheets of 1st & 2nd Milestones
  * Finish 3rd Milestone within your Fourth Study Cycle
  * Finish 4th Milestone within your Fifth Study Cycle
  * Revisit 3rd, 4th Milestone within your Sixth Study Cycle
  * Keep Revising Last Two Milestones, in every Third Study Cycle
