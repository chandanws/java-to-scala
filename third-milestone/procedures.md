* A procedure is a definition which returns no value

* Open program`com.inbravo.lang.ProcedureTest.scala`\[[ProcedureTest.scala](https://github.com/inbravo/scala-src/blob/master/src/main/scala/com/inbravo/lang/ProcedureTest.scala)\] in Eclipse and run...

* Because the procedure doesnâ€™t return any value, you can avoid the = symbol

```scala
/* Look carefully: there is no '=' */
def box(s : String) { 

    val border = "-" * s.length + "--\n"
    println(border + "|" + s + "|\n" + border)
}
```

* If the function body is enclosed in braces without a preceding = symbol, then the return type is `Unit`
* Best is to always use `Unit`in cases where no return type

```scala
def box(s : String): Unit = {

}
```
