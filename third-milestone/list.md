Scala List is immutable sequence of objects that contains the same type of objects. while in java List can be mutable. List are designed to enable functional style of Scala. 

`val oneTwoThree = List(1, 2, 3) // Creating and initialised List`

Common operations on List are ::: to concatenate lists and :: \(cons operator\) to insert an element at starting, these operations will always result in new List, as List are immutable objects in Scala.

Scala use :+ to append operation, but this rarely used, as the time to append a new element increases with the size of list while prepending \(::\) always take constant time.
