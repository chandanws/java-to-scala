1. you can import java Classes library in Scala program same as you can do in Java

   ```
            import java.math.BigInteger
   ```

2. Every value in Scala is an object and every operation is a method call. For example, when you say 1 + 2 in Scala, you are actually invoking a method named + defined in class Int, and 1 and 2 are objects we are passing to this method.

3.  Scalaâ€™s syntax avoids some of the boilerplate that burdens Java programs.

 // this is Java class

 MyClass { 

private int index; 

private String name;

public MyClass\(int index, String name\) { 

this.index = index; this.name = name;

 }

 }

 In Scala, you would likely write this instead: 

class MyClass\(index: Int, name: String\)
