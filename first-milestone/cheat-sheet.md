1. The interactive shell for Scala is simply called scala. You use it by typing `scala`at a command prompt. It starts an interactive shell, which is called **Scala Interpreter,** which reads an expression, evaluates it, prints it, and reads the next expression. This is called [REPL \(Read Evaludate Print Loop\)](http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/repl/overview.html)

2. Scala program [HelloWorld.scala](https://github.com/inbravo/scala-src/blob/master/src/main/scala/com/inbravo/lang/HelloWorld.scala), which uses`main()`

3. Scala program [HelloWorldWithoutMain.scala](https://github.com/inbravo/scala-src/blob/master/src/main/scala/com/inbravo/lang/HelloWorldWithoutMain.scala), which is without` main()`

4. Class import  in Scala program is similar to Java. You are free to import any Java class in your Scala program

5. Scalaâ€™s syntax avoids some of the boilerplate that burdens Java programs. In Scala, you can define a class using `class Employee(name: String, age: String){}`. Same in Java requires...

```java
/* Equivalent Java class */
class Employee { 

      private String name;
      private int age;

      public Person(String name, int age) {

          this.name = name;
          this.age = age;
      }

      public String name() { 
          return this.name; 
      }

      public int age() { 
        return this.age; 
     }
}
```
