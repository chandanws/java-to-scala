1. you can import java Classes library in Scala program same as you can do in Java

   ```
            import java.math.BigInteger
   ```

2. Every value in Scala is an object and every operation is a method call. For example, when you say 1 + 2 in Scala, you are actually invoking a method named + defined in class Int, and 1 and 2 are objects we are passing to this method.
