* Scala dont have static, which is very popular in Java. 

* Inside a Scala program, when you have a class and an object, with same names, then class is called **Companion Class** and  object is called** Companion Object**

* The **Companion Class **and its **Companion Object** both must be defined in the same source file

* Scala lacks static or class access. **Companion Object **gives you this opportunity
