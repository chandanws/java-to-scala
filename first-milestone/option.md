##	Use `None` instead of `null`

*	While it was habit in Java to initialize values to null, Scala provides an Option type for the same purpose
*	In Java, `null` is often used as a placeholder to denote a nonfatal error as a return value or to denote that a variable isnâ€™t yet initialized
*	In Scala, one can denote this through the None subclass of `scala.Option`
*	Class `scala.Option` can prevent unintended null pointer exceptions when using Scala
*	Now Java has also followed Scala and Introduced `java.util.Optional`
