  * As a programmer, we always wanted to quickly play with code, rather then reading the documentation
  * In its Code First approach, this book provides Neatly written Code samples with following cocepts in mind, to increase the readablity 
    * [Code Aesthetics](http://wonko.com/post/code_aesthetics)
    * [Hungarian Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation)

    * [Easy Access on GitHub](http://inbravo.github.io/scala-src)
  * Every chapter of this book is named as **Topic. **Every **Topic **uses specific code examples 
  * Every **Milestone **containts all inter-related **Topics**
  * All code examples of a Topic, can be directly [viewable on GitHub](http://inbravo.github.io/scala-src/) and [Executable on Your Local Enviornment](https://inbravo.gitbooks.io/java-to-scala/content/first-milestone/setup-well-begun-half-done.html)
* **Sense of Achivement: **
  * Content of this book is broken in multiple **Milestones **and **Topics **per Milestone
  * A Topic is based on a minimalistic appraoch, yet giving complete code examples
  * Execution of a code example, gives users a **Sense of Achivement**, in-fact a motivation to read next Topic
  * Idea is to let readers, **Quickly Understand a Scala Concept and Feel Pulled towards Reading Next Scala Concept**
* **Scala is Easy for Java Programmers**
  * Functional programming languages are experiencing a renaissance in recent years, chief among them are Scala and Clojure
