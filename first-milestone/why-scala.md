Functional programming languages are experiencing a renaissance in recent years, chief among them are Scala and Clojure.Scala is more "**fashionable**" these days :\) it provides both object oriented and functional programming and in compatible with Java virtual machine JVM. Functional constructs allows the developer to write short and concise code, whereas object-oriented concepts allows the language to be used for large complex projects. Scala is fully interoperable with the Java language, which allows developers to use all Java libraries from within Scala. Scala is short, having expressive syntax and avoids unnecessary punctuation. As the name "Scala" stands for “scalable language", it is designed to grow with the demands of its users.

The power behind the . Behind the scenes, your input is quickly compiled into bytecode, and the bytecode is executed by the Java virtual machine.

**Why this Book **

In this book we will guide you gently up Scala’s learning curve, one step at a time by giving all the basics and advance example of scala and full setup to make it easy to learn by run the examples by your own. If you’re java programer and wishing to learn Scala, the most challenging aspects  may involve Scala’s type system \(which is richer than Java’s\) and its support for functional programming.In this book we are using eclipse to set up and run scala program, you can use Scala interactive shell as well.
