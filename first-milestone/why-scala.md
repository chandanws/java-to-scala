* **Sense of Achivement: **
  * Content of this book is broken in multiple **Milestones **and **Topics **per Milestone
  * A Topic is based on a minimalistic appraoch, yet giving complete code examples
  * Execution of code examples will lets the users feel a sence of achivement, in-fact a motivation to read next Topic
