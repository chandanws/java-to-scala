**Why this Book? **

* **Code First**: 
  * As a programmer, we always wanted to quickly lay our hands on code, rather then reading any documentation
  * Every chapter of this book is named as **Topic. **Every **Topic **uses some code examples. 
  * All code examples of a Topic, can be directly [**viewable on GitHub**](http://inbravo.github.io/scala-src/) and [**Executable on Your Local Enviornment**](https://inbravo.gitbooks.io/java-to-scala/content/first-milestone/setup-well-begun-half-done.html)
* **Sense of Achivement: **
  * Content of this book is broken in multiple **Milestones **and **Topics **per Milestone
  * A Topic is based on a minimalistic appraoch, yet giving complete code examples
  * Execution of code examples will lets the users feel a sence of achivement, in-fact a motivation to read next Topic
  * Idea is to let readers, **Quickly Understand a Scala Concept and Feel Pulled towards Reading Next Scala Concept**
* **Scala is Easy for Java Programmers**
  * Functional programming languages are experiencing a renaissance in recent years, chief among them are Scala and Clojure
