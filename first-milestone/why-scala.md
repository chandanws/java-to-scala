Functional programming languages are experiencing a renaissance in recent years, chief among them are Scala and Clojure.Scala is more "**fashionable**" these days :\) it provides both object oriented and functional programming and in compatible with Java virtual machine JVM. Functional constructs allows the developer to write short and concise code, whereas object-oriented concepts allows the language to be used for large complex projects. Scala is fully interoperable with the Java language, which allows developers to use all Java libraries from within Scala. Scala is short, having expressive syntax and avoids unnecessary punctuation. As the name "Scala" stands for “scalable language", it is designed to grow with the demands of its users.

The power behind the Scala is it's interpreter, it reads an expression, evaluates it, prints it,and reads the next expression. This is called the read-eval-print loop, or **REPL**. Behind the scenes, your input is quickly compiled into bytecode, and the bytecode is executed by the Java virtual machine. For that reason we call it “the REPL”.
