The name "Scala" stands for “scalable language", because it is designed to grow with the demands of its users.Scala is "**fashionable**" these days :\) as this is the one of the most popular thing in technical world and it helps people solve real problems in an elegant way. Scala is short, having expressive syntax and avoids unnecessary punctuation and in for some problem we can write one line program which would be otherwise pages long in java.

The Scala interpreter reads an expression, evaluates it, prints it,and reads the next expression. This is called theread-eval-print loop, or **REPL**. Technically speaking, the scala program is not an interpreter. Behind the scenes, your input is quickly compiled into bytecode, and the bytecode is executed by the Java virtual machine. For that reason we call it “the REPL”.
