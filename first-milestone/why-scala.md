Functional programming languages are experiencing a renaissance in recent years, chief among them are Scala and Clojure.Scala is more "**fashionable**" these days :\) as it helps people to solve real problems in an elegant way. Scala is short, having expressive syntax and avoids unnecessary punctuation. For some problems we can write one line program which would be otherwise pages long in java or other object oriented language and also as the name "Scala" stands for “scalable language", it is designed to grow with the demands of its users.

The power behind the Scala is it's interpreter, it reads an expression, evaluates it, prints it,and reads the next expression. This is called theread-eval-print loop, or **REPL**. Behind the scenes, your input is quickly compiled into bytecode, and the bytecode is executed by the Java virtual machine. For that reason we call it “the REPL”.
