**Why this Book? **

* **Code First**: 
  * As a programmer, we always wanted to quickly play with code, rather then reading the documentation
  * In its Code First approach, this book provides code samples with following concepts in mind, to increase the readablity 
    * [Code Aesthetics](http://wonko.com/post/code_aesthetics)
    * [Hungarian Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation)
    * [Literate Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming)
    * [Easy Access on GitHub](http://inbravo.github.io/scala-src)
  * All code examples of this book, are directly [viewable on GitHub](http://inbravo.github.io/scala-src/) and [Executable on Your Local Enviornment](https://inbravo.gitbooks.io/java-to-scala/content/first-milestone/setup-well-begun-half-done.html)
* **Sense of Achivement: **
  * Content of this book is broken in multiple **Milestones**
  * Each **Milestone **is broken into 5 ** Topics**
  * Each **Topic **describes a Scala concept with minimalistic appraoch, yet giving complete code examples
  * Execution of a code example, gives users a **Sense of Achivement**, in-fact a motivation to read next Topic
  * Idea is to let readers, **Quickly Understand a Scala Concept and Feel Pulled towards Reading Next Scala Concept**
* **Scala is Easy for Java Programmers**
  * Functional programming languages are experiencing a renaissance in recent years, chief among them are Scala and Clojure
  * Scala is more fashionable these days. It provides both object oriented and functional programming 
  * Scala is interoperable with Java classes, your knowledge of Java API will be helpfull in designing Scala Systems
  * This books considers you a Java Programmer, and try not to dive deeply in revealing all Scala Concepts, which are common with Java
* **Effective Learning**
  * One the main characterstics of every learning process is, our ability to retain the concepts, in long run
  * This books helps in learning against [Forgetting Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve) and It suggests a sample plan based on [Spaced Repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition)
  * Every **Milestone **of this book ends with a topic named **CheatSheet**
  * **CheatSheet **is simple mechanism of refreshing the concepts, freely from anywhere and anytime
  * **CheatSheet **is also a Meaningfull Instrument for Impatients. If you got no time to read complete book, just devour CheatSheet from every Milestone
  * **CheatSheet **acts as [Flash Card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard), which helps, in going against [Forgetting Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve)
  * **CheatSheet **along with readers study plan, created with [Spaced Repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) concept in mind, helps in finishing all Scala concepts from this book
* **Its Your Book**
  * This is a Free Book, you can fork its content from [GitHub](https://github.com/inbravo/java-to-scala) repo, add notes or change examples. You can do anything
  * Keep sharing the benefits of your work to open community
