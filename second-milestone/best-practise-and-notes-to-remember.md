1. There is no native operator available in Scala. Instead, Scala uses a corresponding method which look like an operator.

2. In Scala, you are encouraged to use a val unless you really need to change the contents.
3. In Scala, the type of a variable or function is always written after the
    name of the variable or function. 
4. In scala it is optional to declare the type of val or var, It is evaluated from
    the type of the expression with which you initialize it.
5. In scala semicolons ; are optional and only required if you have multiple statements on the same line. 
6. In scala multiple variables or values can be declare and initialized together as :
    var height, width = 100 // Sets both height and width to 100. 
7. There is no need to write a return statement, as the value of the function is considered to be the return statement.
8. if the function is recursive, it is required to write return type, otherwise it's optional.
9. Scala re-uses Java’s types, and also “dresses them up” to make them nicer.
10. In Scala, arrays are zero based, and you can access an element by specifying  index in parentheses. So the first element in a Scala array named arg is arg\(0\), not arg\[0\], as in Java.
