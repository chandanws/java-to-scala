To Print the value on console you can use "print", "println" or "printf" \(same as C\)

`printf("Hello, %s! You are %d years old.\n", "John", 32)`

You can read a line of input from the console with the `readLine `function. To read a numeric, Boolean, or character value, use `readInt, readDouble, readByte, readShort, readLong, readFloat, readBoolean, or readChar`. with readLine method you can pass string to prompt on console. 

`val name = readLine("Your name: ")`

`//will prompt and wait for input`

`print("Your age: ")`

`//will prompt and wait for input`

`val age = readInt()`

`printf("Hello, %s! Next year, you will be %d.\n", name, age + 1)`
