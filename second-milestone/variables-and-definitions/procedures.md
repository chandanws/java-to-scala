* A procedure is a definition which returns no value

* Open program`com.inbravo.lang.ProcedureTest.scala`\[[ProcedureTest.scala](https://github.com/inbravo/scala-src/blob/master/src/main/scala/com/inbravo/lang/ProcedureTest.scala)\] in Eclipse and run...

```scala
package com.inbravo.lang

/**
 *
 * A function without a return type
 */
object ProcedureTest {

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {

    hello; box("I am a poor human")
  }

  /* A function without a Return Type is called Procedure. Look carefully: there is no '=' */
  def box(s: String) {

    val border = "-" * s.length + "--\n"
    println(border + "|" + s + "|\n" + border)
  }

  /* A function without a Return Type is called Procedure. Just print a 'Hello' */
  def hello = print("Hello")
}
```

* If the function body is enclosed in braces without a preceding = symbol, then the return type is Unit 
* Because the procedure doesnâ€™t return any value, you can avpid the = symbol

```scala
/* Look carefully: there is no '=' */
def box(s : String) { 
    val border = "-" * s.length + "--\n"
    println(border + "|" + s + "|\n" + border)
}
```

* Best is to always use `Unit `in the cases where no return type

```scala
def box(s : String): Unit = {

}
```
