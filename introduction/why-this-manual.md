**Why this Manual?**

* **Scala is Easy for Java Programmers**
  * Functional programming languages are experiencing a renaissance in recent years, chief among them are Scala and Clojure
  * Scala is more fashionable these days. It provides both object oriented and functional programming

  * Scala is interoperable with Java classes, your knowledge of Java API will be helpfull in designing Scala Systems
  * This manual considers you a Java Programmer, and try not to dive deeply in revealing common concepts of Java and Scala
* **Quality Code Examples**: 
  * As a programmer, we always wanted to quickly play with code, rather then reading the documentation
  *	Reading some one else code is always cumbersome 
    ![](/assets/code-quality.png)
  * This manual provides code samples written with following concepts in mind, to increase the readablity 
    * [Code Aesthetics](http://wonko.com/post/code_aesthetics)
    * [Hungarian Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation)
    * [Literate Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming)
    * [Code Examples on GitHub](http://inbravo.github.io/scala-src)
  * All code examples of this manual, are directly [viewable on GitHub](http://inbravo.github.io/scala-src) and [Executable on Your Local Enviornment](https://github.com/inbravo/java-to-scala/blob/master/first-milestone/setup.md)
* **Sense of Achivement:**
  * Content of this manual is broken in various **Milestones**
  * Every **Milestone** contains 5 **Topics**
  * Every **Topic** describes a Scala concept with GitHub code examples
  * By running these code example, users can get a **Sense of Achivement**, in-fact a motivation to read next Topics
  * Idea is to, **Quickly Run and Understand Code for Scala Concept and Feel Pulled towards Reading Next Scala Concept**
* **Effective Learning**
  * One of the main characterstics of a good manual is help readers prepare for lifelong learning

  * This manual helps in learning against [Forgetting Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve) and It suggests a sample plan based on [Spaced Repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition)
  * Every **Milestone** of this manual ends with a topic named **CheatSheet**
  * **CheatSheet** is simple mechanism of refreshing the concepts anytime
  * **CheatSheet** is also a Meaningfull Instrument for Impatients. If you got no time to read complete manual, just devour CheatSheet from every Milestone
  * **CheatSheet** acts as [Flash Card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard), which helps, in going against [Forgetting Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve)
  * **CheatSheet** along with readers study plan, created with [Spaced Repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) concept in mind, helps in finishing all Scala concepts from this manual
* **Its Your Manual**
  * Fork it, Add notes, Add your examples.... You can do anything
  * Keep sharing your work for the benefits to open community
