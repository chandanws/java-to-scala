A class is a blueprint for objects. Once you define a class, you can create objects from the class blueprint with the keyword new.Public is Scalaâ€™s default access level.

Scala is more object-oriented than Java is that classes in Scala cannot have static members.

Any Method under class, when you leave equal sign, return type would always be Unit. Scala compiler can convert any type into Unit.
